    <h2>Comment your JavaScript Code</h2><hr>
    <p>Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.</p>
    <p>There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:</p>
    <p>Using <code>//</code> will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line:</p>
    <pre>// This is an in-line comment.</pre>
    <p>You can make a multi-line comment beginning with <code>/*</code> and ending with <code>*/</code>:</p>
    <pre>/* This is a
   multi-line comment */</pre><p>
    <h3>Best practice</h3>
    <p>As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your codeâ€”both for others <em>and</em> for your future self.</p>
