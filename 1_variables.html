  <h2>Declare JavaScript Variables</h2><hr>
  <p>In computer science, <strong>data</strong> is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides seven different <strong>data types</strong> which are <code>undefined</code>, <code>null</code>, <code>boolean</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>symbol</code>, <code>number</code>, and <code>object</code>.</p>
  <p>For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number <code>12</code>, and <strong>strings</strong>, such as <code>"12"</code>, <code>"dog"</code>, or <code>"123 cats"</code>, which are collections of characters. Computers can perform mathematical operations on a number, but not on a string.</p>
  <p><strong>Variables</strong> allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a <em>label</em> to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the seven data types may be stored in a variable.</p>
  <p><strong>Variables</strong> are similar to the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> variables you use in mathematics, which means they're a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to. Computer variables differ from mathematical variables in that they can store different values at different times.</p>
  <p>We tell JavaScript to create or <strong>declare</strong> a variable by putting the keyword <code>var</code> in front of it, like so:</p>
  <pre>var ourName;</pre>
  <p>The above code creates a <code>var</code>iable called <code>ourName</code>. In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons.</p>
  <p><code>Variable</code> names can be made up of numbers, letters, and <code>$</code> or <code>_</code>, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.</p>
  <br/>

  <h2>Storing Values with the Assignment Operator</h2><hr>
  <p>In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the <strong>assignment</strong> operator.</p>
  <pre>myVariable = 5;</pre>
  <p>The above code assigns the <strong>Number</strong> value <code>5</code> to <code>myVariable</code>.</p>
  <p>Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the <code>=</code> operator is resolved before the value is assigned to the variable to the left of the operator.</p>
  <pre>myVar = 5;
myNum = myVar;</pre>
  <p>The above code assigns <code>5</code> to <code>myVar</code> and then resolves <code>myVar</code> to <code>5</code> again and assigns it to <code>myNum</code>.</p>
  <br/>

  <h2>Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator</h2><hr>
  <p>It is common to <strong>initialize</strong> a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.</p>
  <pre>var myVar = 0;</pre>
  <p>The above code creates a new variable called <code>myVar</code> and assigns it an initial value of <code>0</code>.</p>
